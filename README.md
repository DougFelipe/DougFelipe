<h1 align="center">PhD Focus</h4>

My PhD research focuses on developing and researching innovative biotechnological solutions using microbiology to mitigate environmental pollution through bioremediation. Currently, I am developing a web tool to characterize the bioremediation potential of plants, fungi, and bacteria. With a background in bioinformatics and experience in bacterial cultivation techniques and molecular biology, I aim to integrate molecular techniques with genomic, metagenomic, and metatranscriptomic data to understand and enhance the role of microorganisms in waste treatment and polluted environment recovery. In my undergraduate studies in Software Engineering, my focus is to acquire knowledge that complements my bioinformatics background and contributes to my projects in the field.

## Software Engineering Focus

As a Software Engineering student, I am specializing in Data Science, Data Visualization, Artificial Intelligence, and Computational Intelligence. My primary interests are in applications involving the automation of data science and machine learning pipelines. This includes data engineering, preprocessing, and analytics, all based on DevOps and MLOps practices. My focus as a software engineer is on developing software solutions that integrate these fields and I am driven to apply my knowledge in these fields to develop all-encompassing software solutions.
