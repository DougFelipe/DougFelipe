<h1 align="center">PhD Focus</h4>

My PhD research focuses on developing and researching innovative biotechnological solutions using microbiology to mitigate environmental pollution through bioremediation. Currently, I am developing a web tool to characterize the bioremediation potential of plants, fungi, and bacteria. With a background in bioinformatics and experience in bacterial cultivation techniques and molecular biology, I aim to integrate molecular techniques with genomic, metagenomic, and metatranscriptomic data to understand and enhance the role of microorganisms in waste treatment and polluted environment recovery. In my undergraduate studies in Software Engineering, my focus is to acquire knowledge that complements my bioinformatics background and contributes to my projects in the field.

Additionally, I am deepening my expertise in Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, and Computational Intelligence applied to Software Engineering.

## Collaboration

I am always available for productive discussions and open to opportunities to collaborate on interdisciplinary projects in Environmental Biotechnology and Data Science.
